The game “Ventura” is built in Godot engine using GDScript (similar to python). It is 2D puzzle-
platform video game, incorporating a physics system that governs environmental objects and the player character.

- The game character was designed and animated in Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 and was deployed in Godot Game Engine.
- Different objects (Sprites, Tilesets etc.)  were implemented using the built-in feature of Godot engine.
- The physics governing these objects were written as classes and functions using GDScript for the convenience in coding and level designing.

How to get started?
Install the latest Godot engine depending on the architecture of your computer and implement the objects and functions present in this repo.
